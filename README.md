# Khinseider AntiRedirect
Makes khinseider stop redirecting you when clicking download on a soundtrack. Also directly downloads the soundtracks instead of redirecting and includes a right click save as directly from the album's page.

Check out their website, [its awesome](https://downloads.khinsider.com/)!
**This fan-made extension is NOT associated with khinseider.**
