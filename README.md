# Khinsider AntiRedirect
Makes khinsider stop redirecting you when clicking download on a soundtrack. Also directly downloads the soundtracks instead of redirecting and includes a right click save as directly from the album's page.

Check out their website, [its awesome](https://downloads.khinsider.com/)!
**This fan-made extension is NOT associated with khinsider.**

# How to Install 
Download the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension on any browser, then install the script directly from source here or by clicking on [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/465149-khinseider-antiredirect).
